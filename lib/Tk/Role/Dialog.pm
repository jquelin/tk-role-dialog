# -- accessors

=attr parent

The parent window of the dialog, required.

=attr hidden

Whether the dialog should popup or stay hidden after creation. Default
to false, which means the dialog is shown.

=attr icon

The path to an image to be used as window icon. Default to empty string
(meaning no customized window icon), but not required.

=attr title

The dialog title, default to C<tk dialog>.

=attr header

A header (string) to display at the top of the window. Default to empty
string, meaning no header.

=attr image

The path to an image to be displayed alongside the dialog text. Not
taken into account if C<text> attribute is empty. Default to empty
string, meaning no image.

=attr text

Some text to be displayed, for simple information dialog boxes. Default
to empty string, meaning dialog is to be filled by providing a
C<_build_gui()> method. Can be combined with an C<image> attribute for
enhanced appearance.

=attr resizable

A boolean to control whether the dialog can be resized or not (default).

=attr ok

A string to display as validation button label. Default to empty string,
meaning no validation button. The validation action will call
C<< $self->_valid() >>.

=attr cancel

A string to display as cancellation button label. Default to empty
string, meaning no cancellation button. The cancel action is to just
close the dialog.

=attr hide

A string to display as hiding button label. Default to empty
string, meaning no hiding button. The hiding action is to just
hide the dialog (think C<withdraw>).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Tk::Role::Dialog> is meant to be used as a L<Moose> role to be
composed for easy L<Tk> dialogs creation.

It will create a new toplevel with a title, and possibly a header as
well as some buttons.

One can create the middle part of the dialog by providing a
C<_build_gui()> method, that will receive a L<Tk::Frame> where widgets
are supposed to be placed.

The attributes (see below) can be either defined as defaults using the
C<_build_attr()> methods, or passed arguments to the constructor call.
The only mandatory attribute is C<parent>, but you'd better provide some
other attributes if you want your dialog to be somehow usable! :-)
